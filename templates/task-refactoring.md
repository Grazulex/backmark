# Code Refactoring

## 🔧 Refactoring Goal

{What needs to be improved and why}

## 🎯 Objectives

- [ ] Improve code maintainability
- [ ] Enhance code readability
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Reduce technical debt
- [ ] Improve test coverage

## 📊 Current State

### Problems with Current Code
- {Issue 1}
- {Issue 2}
- {Issue 3}

### Code Smells Identified
- [ ] Duplicated code
- [ ] Long methods/functions
- [ ] Large classes
- [ ] Too many parameters
- [ ] Complex conditionals
- [ ] Dead code
- [ ] Other: {specify}

### Metrics (if applicable)
- **Current complexity:** {cyclomatic complexity}
- **Current test coverage:** {percentage}
- **Current performance:** {metrics}

## 🤖 AI Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Understand current implementation**
   - Map code dependencies
   - Identify all usages
   - Review tests (if any)
   - Document current behavior

2. **Define refactoring strategy**
   - Choose refactoring patterns
   - Plan incremental steps
   - Identify risks
   - Plan rollback strategy

### Phase 2: Preparation
3. **Ensure test coverage**
   - Add missing tests
   - Verify tests are comprehensive
   - Ensure tests pass before refactoring

4. **Create refactoring checklist**
   - Break down into small steps
   - Order steps for safety
   - Define success criteria for each step

### Phase 3: Refactoring
5. **Apply refactoring incrementally**
   - One small change at a time
   - Run tests after each change
   - Commit frequently
   - Keep code working at all times

6. **Verify improvements**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check performance metrics
   - Review code quality metrics
   - Get code review

### Phase 4: Cleanup
7. **Final polish**
   - Remove dead code
   - Update documentation
   - Update comments
   - Clean up imports

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code is more maintainable and readable
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] No change in functionality (unless intentional)
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review approved

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### Quality Metrics
- **Code complexity:** Reduce by {target}
- **Test coverage:** Increase to {target}%
- **Lines of code:** {increase/decrease/maintain}

### Maintainability
- Easier to understand
- Easier to modify
- Easier to test
- Better separation of concerns

### Performance
- {Expected performance improvements, if any}

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Breaking existing functionality**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
2. **Performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark before and after
3. **Introducing new bugs**
   - Mitigation: Small incremental changes with testing

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Before Refactoring
- [ ] Document current behavior
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Add missing test coverage
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

### During Refactoring
- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] Verify no functionality changes
- [ ] Check performance regularly

### After Refactoring
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Manual testing in key areas
- [ ] Code review
